Exercise: Learning About For Loops
// Let's check all days of the week using a FOR Loop
// Use the same variables from the other exercise
// create a new variable called daysOfWeek that is a string array of all the days of the week i.e. ["sunday", "monday", ...]
// create a function called canWeGoToTheMovies that has no parameters
// create a variable called whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies that is an empty string. i.e. there is nothing inside the open and close quotes
// output/print the days of the week we are checking. What would we use to do that?
// i.e. We are checking the days of the week: daysOfWeek
// Create a for loop using the length of daysOfWeek as the condition
// create a variable called dayOfWeek that will have the day of week as we iterate over the array
// create an if statement for myFriendsSchedule and myMoneySchedule
// Using bracket notation lookup the day of the week for both objects, find out if my friend is free AND I have the money
// If they have the time AND I have the money then we can go! Add that to the whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies string
// ex. "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? Yes, let's go to the movies!!"
// Create an if/else statement to check if my friend has the time OR if I have the money
// If they have the time OR I have the money then we can go!  Add that to the whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies string
// ex. "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? One of us can go to the movies"
// Create an else statement
// if NEITHER they have the time AND I don't have the money then we can not go :(
// ex: "On " + theDateWeWantToGo + "? We can't go to the movies"
// output/print the variable whatDaysCanWeGoToTheMovies
// exit the function
// call the function
